                    <h3>Arctic fox</h3>
                    <p>The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small
                        fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic
                        tundra biome. It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its
                        thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the
                        wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to
                        11 years. Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a generally rounded body
                        shape to minimize the escape of body heat. </p>

                    <h3>Kit fox</h3>
                    <p>The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a fox species that inhabits arid and semi-arid regions of
                        western North America, primarily in the Southwestern United States and northern and central
                        Mexico. These foxes are the smallest of the three species of Vulpes occurring in North America
                        and are among the smallest of the vulpines worldwide. It has also been called a North American
                        counterpart of the Fennec fox due to its large ears.</p>

                    <h3>Red fox</h3>
                    <p>The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely
                        distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere
                        including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as
                        least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been
                        introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations.
                        Due to its presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive
                        species".</p>
